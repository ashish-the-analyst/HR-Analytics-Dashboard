I created a HR Dashboard using Microsoft PowerBI. I imported the HR analytics dataset and used different pre-processing techniques to clean and prepare the data for further exploration. 
I used the dataset to calculate the attrition rate of a company based on employee's age, employee's role in the company, age group, salary as well as different departments they belonged to.
